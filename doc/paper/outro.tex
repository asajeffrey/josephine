\section{Conclusions}

The contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}

\item An implementation of the ideas in $L^3$~\cite{l3} to mixed
  linear/non-linear programming~\cite{mixed}, where the
  linear language is Rust and the non-linear language is
  JavaScript.

\item A treatment of garbage collection (rather than region-based
  memory management) for such a system.

\item A treatment of how operations such as accessing, mutating, and
  rooting can change the lifetimes of objects.
  
\end{itemize}

Formalization.

Rooting scopes.

Cross-compartment wrappers.

FFI.

Scale up.
